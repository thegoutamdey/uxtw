****](https://airbnb.design/evolving-by-design/?ref=uxthisweek)Delivering a seamless user experience to a global audience requires an understanding of how different markets access, consume, and interpret products and information.

\*\*\*\*[**Digital products are having their “assembly line” moment—here’s how to stay relevant**](https://www.invisionapp.com/inside-design/design-systems-revolution-how-to-adapt/?ref=uxthisweek)\*\*\*\*[  
****](https://uxplanet.org/10-simple-tips-to-improve-user-testing-6a86c84e2794/?ref=uxthisweek)Each UI is essentially “hand-crafted”, with designers trying to improve specific aspects without a clearly-defined scope \(usually caused by silos between design and product teams\) and undocumented institutional knowledge from designers who built related UIs previously. Every new UI or update is an inconsistent offshoot of what’s come before.

\*\*\*\*[**App Bar UI design tips**](https://setproduct.com/blog/appbar-ui-design/?ref=uxthisweek)  
The exploration for Application Bar component: Anatomy, Themes, Styling, Use cases, Templates and Inspiration

\*\*\*\*[**Quicker UX Research Synthesis**](https://uxtools.co/blog/quicker-ux-research-synthesis/?ref=uxthisweek)\*\*\*\*[  
****](https://uxdesign.cc/how-bob-moog-brought-usability-heuristics-to-the-electronic-synthesizer-a6797a3a9192)Cluttered whiteboards and sticky notes are proven ways to process your research, but not the most efficient ways. Instead, consider how you can synthesize your research as you go.
